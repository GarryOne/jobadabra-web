  // Not Opus: it beat Sonnet 9-1 and Haiku 23-7 only when Opus was the judge; the Sonnet judge gave 6-4 over Sonnet and 16-14 over Haiku (15 cases), noise at 2x Sonnet's price. Re-test with a judge of another family before switching.
  kit: {model: SONNET, gain: 'Sonnet beat Haiku 13-7 on letters, both judges agree', cases: 5},

  // Why (27 Oct 2026, owner: "let's add Sonnet here"): interview patterns (its own action name since the app's patterns call left 'interview', which is the call review where Haiku won 15-5):
  // Sonnet beat Haiku 13-7 and Opus 15-5 on 5 cases; the Sonnet judge gave Sonnet every case but one, the Opus judge split (Opus won only 'rounds'), so the gain is real but the sample is small.
  interview_patterns: {model: SONNET, gain: 'Sonnet beat Haiku 13-7 and Opus 15-5 on patterns', cases: 5},
  // Why (27 Oct 2026, owner: "Use sonnet for writing and that's it"; a Pro user's text should read richer than Haiku's): every step that writes text for the person runs on Sonnet.
  // The 5-case head-to-heads had Haiku ahead on reviews, weekly summaries and tied on prep, but the judge prompt scores "unsupported facts count heavily against", so it rewards a model that adds nothing; public benchmarks put Sonnet 5.5 ahead overall (34 of 36). Cost: about 20x Haiku per token.

  // 'tailor' is also the action of the CV reading calls (transcription, change review): they follow it to Sonnet until the app gives the writing call its own name. TODO(AI): split 'tailor' in desktop/lib/cv.js (27 Oct 2026).
