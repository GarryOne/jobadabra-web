// cancelled job, a CI step that failed before the suite, the AI key's credit, a green second try), then the fix's own words (an "E2E-cause:" trailer), and only then
// an AI call with a fixed answer (CLAUDE.md "The AI decides"): no keyword list guesses drift, test bug or product bug. Rules 1-2 (18-24 Oct) read only the fix's
// files and left 49% of reds "unknown" or "not fixed yet" and "test bug" at 0. Guard: test/admin/e2e-causes.test.js.

// group: who caused it. ours = our CI and AI plumbing, tests = the e2e tests, app = the product. The page sums by group first.
