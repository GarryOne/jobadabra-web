// The night report-only suites' measured rates, read from a suite job's log (counts only, never stored): the shape suiteNights[].rates already has (admin/e2e-grey.js, every rate 0..1,
// higher is better, so "lowest of the night" is the worst). Added 1 Nov 2026 (owner, via mac-07: nightly report-only numbers on the Testing Overview and Scheduled): until then
// nothing wrote `rates`, so the Grey card and the Overview had only green/red for interactions. Pure: the collector (jobs/e2e-intel.mjs) passes the log text. Guard: test/admin/e2e-rates.test.js.

// Suites whose log carries rates; the value is the reader of that log.
