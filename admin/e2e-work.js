// Where e2e work goes (owner, 28 Oct 2026: "how many commits/work is around plumbing and how much is about e2e expectations?"; spec docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-28-e2e-reliability-design.md
// rule J in the public repo): each commit of the public repo's main gets ONE kind from the paths it touched, the first that matches in WORK_KINDS' order, so a
// product commit that also edits a workflow counts as product, and "plumbing" means a commit that changed only CI or harness plumbing. Pure, shared by the collector
// (jobs/e2e-intel.mjs: reads `git log`, sends the rows) and the page (admin/e2e-page.js). Guard: test/admin/e2e-work.test.js.

// Why (28 Oct 2026, the design session): the owner's target is plumbing under 15% of commits a week; by these rules main had 654 plumbing of 2,329 commits (28%), 14-27 Oct.
