// /admin/testing/overview: a method line that only runs by hand (debugging) is labelled that way and its last run never paints the card red.
// Incident (1 Nov 2026, owner: "let's fix this"): the Real-site pool card was red from "Offline replays · with the nightly run ✗ red · 5 days ago", a by-hand run of site-replays.yml,
// a workflow that has had no schedule since 17 Oct 2026 (owner: "Replays stay for debugging only").
